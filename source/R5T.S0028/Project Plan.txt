R5T.S0028 - Survey all local project files, then add to a file-based project repository.

## GOALS:


## PLAN

Operations:

* SurveyCurrentProjects: Survey all current (local file system) project file paths.
	Inputs: Non
	Outputs: Projects[]
* PerformAnalysis: Perform new/departed projects analysis.
	Inputs: AnalysisInputData
	Outputs: AnalysisOutputData
* DetermineHumanActionsRequired: Determine if human actions are required
	Inputs: AnalysisOutputData
	Outputs: HumanActionsRequired
* PromptForHumanActions: Prompt for human actions
	Inputs: AnalysisInputData, AnalysisOutputData
	Outputs: None
* PerformHumanActions: Perform human actions. Does not complete until all mandatory human operations are complete. Performs the analysis, determines human actions, and prompts for human actions in a loop.
	Inputs: AnalysisInputData
	Outputs: AnalysisOutputData
* SkipHumanActionsOrStopIfAnyMandatory
	Inputs: AnalysisInputData
	Outputs: AnalysisOutputData
* UpdateRepository
	Inputs: AnalysisOutputData
	Outputs: None
	
* BackupRepositoryData: backup repository data.

* O100_RunPromptingForHumanActions: An operation running the set of operations including prompting for human actions.
* O101_RunSkippingHumanActions: An operation running the set of operations including skipping human actions or stopping if any are mandatory.

* O000_MainOperation: An entry-point operation that runs the operation running the set of operations including prompting for human action (the default S0028 operation).

Analysis Processes:

* New/Departed projects.
	* AnalysisInputData
		* RepositoryProjects
		* Projects
	* AnalysisOutputData
		* NewProjects
		* DepartedProjects

Human Actions Required:

* Evaluate new projects.
* Evaluate departed projects.

* Mandatory: None
